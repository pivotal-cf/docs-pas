title: TAS for VMs v5.0 Release notes
owner: Release Engineering
---

These are the release notes for <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for 2023.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

  ## Changes
  - Healthchecks for process startup have been renamed from "readiness" to "startup" to better indicate that it is the initial liveness check to ensure the process has started. After completing, it is superceded by the liveness check, which has had no changes.
  - Adds support for "readiness" checks on processes. The purpose of readiness checks are to determine whether a process is capable of serving traffic or not. This is contrasted now with liveness checks which determine if the process is in a state that requires it to be restarted. Readiness checks can be used to pull a process out of service when they fail, while not restarting the process. Once readiness is passing again, the process will be re-added into the service pool. Removal/addition of processes to the service pool is done via route-emitter.
  - `cfdot actual-lrps` now behaves in a more expected behavior regarding the display of `host_tls_proxy_port`. It should always be preset, even if the value is `0`.
  - Bumped to golang 1.20.7.

  ## Changes
  - 🐛Fixed a bug with garden-windows where process directories were being leaked in the garden depot. This adds a `garden.cleanup_process_dirs_on_wait` property to mimic cleanup logic from garden-linux. This property is defaulted to true on garden-windows, to keep the desired behavior for CF/Diego. If garden-windows is ever used with Concourse, users will want to set this to false.

  - The seeded_users feature now supports a new "multi-schema-admin" role. This
  role allows creating a MySQL user with access to a set of databases defined
  by a wildcard "schema" pattern.
  See [this ops-file](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/pxc-release/blob/main/operations/test/with-wildcard-schema-access.yml)

  - Bumped vendored dependencies
  - The pxc-mysql job's BOSH `drain` script has been converted to a `post-stop`
  script. The post-stop script now skips safety check logic around scaling
  down a cluster when the deployment is being deleted to avoid a flake when
  deleting a clustered deployment.
  - Percona XtraBackup and Percona XtraDB Cluster packages now compile in
  parallel to reduce overall pxc-release compilation times

  I'm pleased to announce the release of the java-buildpack, version 4.61.0. This release includes the Java quarterly patch releases, as well updates to the following frameworks/agents:
  * AppDynamics
  * Azure App Insights
  * Datadog
  * Elastic APM
  * JRebel
  * New Relic
  * Splunk Otel
  * Takipi Agent
  * Tomcat
  Additional Changes:
  - This release corrects the type of Takipi/Overops agent that was included with the buildpack since `4.60.0`
  - The Google Stackdriver Debugger has been disabled by default as announced in the previous release, the Google service is no longer available & they will no longer support the agent after August 2023. Until then, users can re-enable by forking the buildpack, however the integration will be removed completely in a future release.
  For a more detailed look at the changes in 4.61.0, please take a look at the [commit log](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/compare/v4.60.0...v4.61.0). The packaged version of the buildpack, suitable for use with create-buildpack and update-buildpack, can be found attached to this release.

  ## What's Changed
  * Bump to go 1.20.7
  * Bump dependencies
  * Adds experimental `otel-collector` and `otel-collector-windows` jobs. See the following [RFC](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/3ec376e4345787bc0e9e25e7965c5083b63db822/toc/rfc/rfc-0018-aggregate-metric-egress-with-opentelemetry-collector.md) for more information.
  ### Forwarder Agent log format change
  Previously when the `logging.format.timestamp` property was set to `rfc3339` it would be ignored for ingress client logs emitted by the Forwarder Agent. This release applies the correct timestamp format when `rfc3339` is selected, which may affect you if you depend on the format of the logs.
  Old log line format:
  ```
  [INGRESS CLIENT] -> 127.0.0.1:3459: 2023/08/04 21:59:31 Error while flushing: EOF
  ```
  New log line format:
  ```
  2023-08-04T22:23:53.099290367Z [INGRESS CLIENT] -> 127.0.0.1:3459: Error while flushing: EOF
  ```

  ## Changes
  In [nats-release v46](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nats-release/releases/tag/v46), we migrated the underlying binary from `gnatsd` (NATS v1), to `nats-server` (NATS v2). In this release, we are adding a post-start check that will fail the deployment if, for some reasons, NATS instances are running v1. This is a precursor to eventually removing the v1 binary and migration wrapper. The property defaults to `false`, but will default to `true` in [cf-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/).
  If your instances are already running NATS v2, or if they successfully migrate to v2 in this release, you will not experience any change in behavior. If you want to confirm your NATS instances are on v2, [follow the steps in this KB article](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-confirm-your-nats-servers-are-running-NATs-v2?language=en_US).

  Use buildpack: not buildpacks: when pushing apps
  commit 1e126975456904d627049bc95dceb83063936566
  Author: David Stevenson <stevensonda@vmware.com>
  Date:   Wed Jul 19 12:20:56 2023 -0700
  Use buildpack: not buildpacks: when pushing apps
  - This is because you cannot seem to go back to "automatic" buildpack
  selection using the buildpacks: null. buildpack: is deprecated but it
  will still work for a URL and automatic (via null).

  I'm pleased to announce the release of the java-buildpack, version 4.60.0. This release includes updates to dependency frameworks, such as:
  ​
  * [Updates JProfiler to 13.x line](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/commit/7e2a7b9c9cd954838262b968d4b8efce15f78449)
  * [Handle Dynatrace API Token in the sanitizer](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/pull/974) thank you @rbamberger
  * [Add Takipi agent mandatory JVM arguments if Java is 9+ ](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/commit/63c8d1e146af4a2b009e987977c4aca7fcdc500f) thank you @M-Tsur
  * [Install ruby whenever it isn't already present](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/commit/fe9f6d232ea0fbb6ecb6b6fe66539ef8147dfcc6) thank you @dsabeti
  * [Updates repository location for AppD](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/commit/fcc977dca0736cd157e8b83a94248cc1a5e79250)
  ​
  ## Important Deprecation Notice: [Google Stackdriver Debugger](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/main/docs/framework-google_stackdriver_debugger.md)
  ​
  Due to the [deprecation of the Google Stackdriver Debugger](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/deprecations/debugger-deprecation) and the fact that its replacement, the [snapshot-debugger](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/snapshot-debugger) will only be supported until August 31st 2023, the next release of the Java Buildpack will no longer include Google StackDriver nor its OSS replacement. Please let us know if you have concerns!
  ​
  ​
  There were also dependency bumps for other libraries, including:
  ​
  - YourKit Profiler
  - Tomcat
  - SpringBoot CLI
  - Splunk
  - SkyWalking Agent
  - SeaLights Agent
  - NewRelic
  - JRebel Agent
  - CA Wily (Introscope) framework
  - Elastic Agent
  - Datadog Agent
  - Contrast Agent
  - Azure Insights
  ​
  ​
  For a more detailed look at the changes in 4.60.0, please take a look at the [commit log](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/compare/v4.59.0...v4.60.0). The packaged version of the buildpack, suitable for use with create-buildpack and update-buildpack, can be found attached to this release.

  Use buildpack: not buildpacks: when pushing apps
  commit 1e126975456904d627049bc95dceb83063936566
  Author: David Stevenson <stevensonda@vmware.com>
  Date:   Wed Jul 19 12:20:56 2023 -0700
  Use buildpack: not buildpacks: when pushing apps
  - This is because you cannot seem to go back to "automatic" buildpack
  selection using the buildpacks: null. buildpack: is deprecated but it
  will still work for a URL and automatic (via null).

  ## Changes
  - Bumps golang to 1.20.6
  - Resolves a bug in gorouter where path-based routes could return 503s when no backend endpoints remain, rather than falling back to non-path (hostname-only) routes. Thanks @domdom82!

  ⚠️ This release is vulnerable to [this known issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/blob/develop/docs/go-1.20-expect-100-continue-known-issue.md) around handling expect 100-continue responses. We recommend skipping this version and upgrading to 0.274.0 instead.
  ## Changes
  - ✨ `route_registrar` now emites route registration events immediately upon startup, rather than waiting for a full registration interval to pass. This will cut down on accidental TTL expiry incurred by restarting route-registrar.
  - ✨ The `router.enable_log_attempts_details` property has been added to allow operators to configure Gorouter to log additional information about retried attempts to send requests to backends. Thanks @maxmoehl!
  - 🐛Specifying multiple CA certs to route_registrar via `route_registrar.routing_api.ca_certs` will now render correctly as multiple certs in a single CA file.
  - 🐛 Routing API clients now correctly refresh their UAA tokens prior to expiry. This should help prevent `route_registrar` from crashing whenever the token expires.
  - Golang package dependency bumps

  I'm pleased to announce the release of the java-buildpack, version 4.60.0. This release includes updates to dependency frameworks, such as:
  ​
  * [Updates JProfiler to 13.x line](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/commit/7e2a7b9c9cd954838262b968d4b8efce15f78449)
  * [Handle Dynatrace API Token in the sanitizer](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/pull/974) thank you @rbamberger
  * [Add Takipi agent mandatory JVM arguments if Java is 9+ ](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/commit/63c8d1e146af4a2b009e987977c4aca7fcdc500f) thank you @M-Tsur
  * [Install ruby whenever it isn't already present](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/commit/fe9f6d232ea0fbb6ecb6b6fe66539ef8147dfcc6) thank you @dsabeti
  * [Updates repository location for AppD](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/commit/fcc977dca0736cd157e8b83a94248cc1a5e79250)
  ​
  ## Important Deprecation Notice: [Google Stackdriver Debugger](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/main/docs/framework-google_stackdriver_debugger.md)
  ​
  Due to the [deprecation of the Google Stackdriver Debugger](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/deprecations/debugger-deprecation) and the fact that its replacement, the [snapshot-debugger](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/snapshot-debugger) will only be supported until August 31st 2023, the next release of the Java Buildpack will no longer include Google StackDriver nor its OSS replacement. Please let us know if you have concerns!
  ​
  ​
  There were also dependency bumps for other libraries, including:
  ​
  - YourKit Profiler
  - Tomcat
  - SpringBoot CLI
  - Splunk
  - SkyWalking Agent
  - SeaLights Agent
  - NewRelic
  - JRebel Agent
  - CA Wily (Introscope) framework
  - Elastic Agent
  - Datadog Agent
  - Contrast Agent
  - Azure Insights
  ​
  ​
  For a more detailed look at the changes in 4.60.0, please take a look at the [commit log](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/compare/v4.59.0...v4.60.0). The packaged version of the buildpack, suitable for use with create-buildpack and update-buildpack, can be found attached to this release.

  Use buildpack: not buildpacks: when pushing apps
  commit 1e126975456904d627049bc95dceb83063936566
  Author: David Stevenson <stevensonda@vmware.com>
  Date:   Wed Jul 19 12:20:56 2023 -0700
  Use buildpack: not buildpacks: when pushing apps
  - This is because you cannot seem to go back to "automatic" buildpack
  selection using the buildpacks: null. buildpack: is deprecated but it
  will still work for a URL and automatic (via null).

  ## Changes
  - Bumps golang to 1.20.6
  - Resolves a bug in gorouter where path-based routes could return 503s when no backend endpoints remain, rather than falling back to non-path (hostname-only) routes. Thanks @domdom82!

  ## Changes
  - ✨ `route_registrar` now emites route registration events immediately upon startup, rather than waiting for a full registration interval to pass. This will cut down on accidental TTL expiry incurred by restarting route-registrar.
  - ✨ The `router.enable_log_attempts_details` property has been added to allow operators to configure Gorouter to log additional information about retried attempts to send requests to backends. Thanks @maxmoehl!
  - 🐛Specifying multiple CA certs to route_registrar via `route_registrar.routing_api.ca_certs` will now render correctly as multiple certs in a single CA file.
  - 🐛 Routing API clients now correctly refresh their UAA tokens prior to expiry. This should help prevent `route_registrar` from crashing whenever the token expires.
  - Golang package dependency bumps

  **New Features**
  Removed default configuration of wsrep_applier_threads of 1.
  `engine_config.wsrep_applier_threads` is now automatically set to the number of cores on the host machine, to enable
  better throughput by using the available resources / compute.
  **Known Issues**
  Currently an issue is being investigated which might lead to data corruption when updating from earlier versions of this

## <a id='new-features'></a> New features in <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

### Readiness Health Checks

App Developers can now setup readiness health checks for their apps. Readiness
health checks are performed to validate that app instances are ready to serve
requests. When readiness health checks fail, the app instance is marked as not
ready and removed from the route pool for the app. See this
<a href='/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html'>doc</a> for more information.

This feature requires:

* garden-runc-release 1.37.0
* diego-release 2.81.0
* capi-release 1.158.0

### Add OpenTelemetry Collector (Beta)

In addition to Aggregate Syslog Drains and the Firehose, TAS 5.0 provides beta support for exporting metrics in
aggregate off the platform using the OpenTelemetry Collector.

This beta feature allows operators to export metrics over the OpenTelemetry Protocol, which is supported by many
different observability platforms. We're excited about the possibilities this provides and interested in any feedback
you have, including whether additional exporters might be useful.

Enabling the Collector consumes additional resources on each VM. VMware recommend that operators load test deployments to
size VMs correctly. Operators with deployments that use VM types with CPU bursting must ensure there are
sufficient reserved vCPUs for the increased CPU consumed.

In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> 5.0.0 foundations with more than 150 VMs may not send all system metrics to the
OpenTelemetry Collector.

Note that this feature is beta, so it may still change in significant ways.

### Log Cache Syslog Server supports mTLS

Operators can now configure Log Cache communication with Syslog Agents to use mutual TLS.

We recommend that operators who want to enable this feature perform a two-step deployment.
First, upgrade to TAS for VMs 5.0, and then enable mTLS in a separate deployment.

## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

### Logging timestamp format property removed

In TAS 4.0 the `logging_timestamp_format` product property was changed to have no effect. In TAS for VMs 5.0 this property is
removed. If you have automation that sets this property, you must remove references to it before upgrading.

### Autoscaler API no longer accepts trailing slashes in requests

Previously, the Autoscaler API responded to a URL with a trailing slash and now it returns a 404 error.

If you use the API directly, confirm that you are not including trailing slashes in the URL before you upgrade.

This does not affect users who are using the autoscaler cf CLI plug-in.

### Syslog aggregate drains property changes

The `syslog_agent_aggregate_drains` property used to declare syslog aggregate drains has been changed to allow aggregate
drains to be configured with Mutual TLS.

If you try to configure TAS for VMs with the older comma-separated syntax for defining aggregate drains, you will see the
following error from Tanzu Operations Manager (Ops Manager):

```
{"errors":{".properties.syslog_agent_aggregate_drains":["is not a property"]}}
```

References to the old property must be updated to refer to the new `mtls_syslog_agent_aggregate_drains` property.
This property is used to define aggregate syslog drains with keys and certificates for Mutual TLS, and to define
aggregate drains that are not using Mutual TLS.

Comma-separated strings are no longer accepted. Instead, pass an array of aggregate drains:

```
.properties.mtls_syslog_agent_aggregate_drains:
  value:
  - url: syslog-tls://HOSTNAME:PORT
  - url: syslog-tls://ANOTHER-HOSTNAME:PORT
```

### NATS intentionally fails deployment in post-start in v1.

In TAS for VMs 3.0, we migrated the underlying binary for nats-release from gnatsd (NATS v1) to nats-server (NATS v2).
Before removing the v1 code completely, we're adding a post-start check to confirm that NATS instances
are running nats-server.

To avoid experiencing a deployment failure, confirm the NATS version by following the directions here:
[How to confirm your nats servers are running NATS v2](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-confirm-your-nats-servers-are-running-NATs-v2?language=en_US).
Environments that have successfully upgraded NATS will not experience any change.

### Metrics Agent and Metrics Discovery Registrar deprecated and disabled by default

Metrics Agent is turned off by default in this release. Metrics Agent collects
metrics that pass through the Loggregator Agent and exposes them through a
Prometheus endpoint. Metrics Agent was intended to be used by internal components, but was
never adopted. With the move to OpenTelemetry Collector, anyone needing this
functionality is encouraged to configure a Prometheus Exporter in the
OpenTelemetry Collector. Metrics Agent is scheduled to be removed in TAS 6.0.
