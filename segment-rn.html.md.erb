This topic contains release notes for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for 2023.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

  ## Changes
  ⚠️We have removed the garden-healthcheck job from garden while we investigate a way to make it less painful. From v1.22.6 through v1.28.0, garden restarts with a high container count could result in BOSH deploys failing due to a race condition between garden, bpm, monit, and garden-healthchecker. This will be re-enabled at a later time when we resolve the race condition.

  ## Changes
  - 🐛Fixes the of golang has a known issue that causes backend request failures which previously returned 496, 499, 503, 525, or 526 to instead return a 502. Additionally stale routes may not have been pruned properly. Thanks @domdom82!!
  - 🚗Gorouter now retries requests which fail prior to any HTTP content being sent (since no backend received the HTTP content, they're by definition retriable). Thanks for the [PR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/pull/337). Thanks @maxmoehl and @domdom82!!

  ## Changes
  - Dependency updates (cf cli, healthchecker, golang)
  - Many CI Updates - Thanks @jrussett!
  - 🐛[#310]The routing_utils route loader now sets the route service url when loading. Thanks @domdom82 !
  - 🐛Two issues in route_registrar were fixed that led to routes expiring and then being re-registered with the same details:
  - Starting in v0.x.x, route_registrar no longer retried UAA connections when getting a token from UAA. Instead, the failure would cause route_registrar to restart, and reset it's emitter intervals.
  - The built in route expiry has been increased from RegistrationInterval + 2 seconds to 2.1 * RegistrationInterval. This prevent routes from expiring during the course of a route_registrar restart.
  - 🐛If tcp_router received routing events during its BulkSync cycle, it would always rewrite the haproxy configuration, and reload the haproxy process. This would occur regardless of whether the events required a new haproxy config. It now only updates the config + reloads haproxy if changes are necessary.

  ## What's Changed
  - When the `router.ca_certs` property switched from a multi-line string of certs, to an array of certs, gorouter started failing to start up if any of the certs provided were invalid. Previously they were ignored. This has been reverted, so that any invalid CA certs are ignored during startup. Thanks @ameowlia!

  ## What's Changed
  * Switch to healthecker package in cf-networking-helpers by @mariash in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/pull/302
  * Add healthchecker package to sync-package-specs file by @mariash in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/pull/303
  * **Potential Breaking Change:** In preperation for mtls between gorouter and routing api, add gorouter backends ca to routing-api. Rendering these certs depends on routing-api consuming a link from gorouter. If you have multiple gorouter instance groups (for example in the case of isolation segments), you will need to rename bosh links to prevent the error "Multiple link providers found. For an example of link renaming, see [this ops file](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/main/operations/test/add-persistent-isolation-segment-router.yml#L74) by @reneighbor in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/pull/300

  ## What's Changed
  * Gorouter's pre-start script now reserves ports used by other CF components when it increases the number of ephemeral ports available via `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_reserved_ports`. This resolves issues when components fail to start up during deploys/monit restarts due to accidental port collisions with outbound traffic from the VM. Thanks @ameowlia !
  * Routing-release no longer makes use of the deprecated uaa-go-client, and uses go-uaa instead
  * The `routing_utils/nats_client` helper utility now supports saving + loading gorouter's routing tables! Thanks @domdom82 !
  * Fixed a memory leak with `gorouter` that resulted in HTTP request objects being held open if a client canceled the connection before the App responded.  Thanks @geofffranks !

  * It does not limit the size of the request body.
  * An additional padding of 4096 bytes is added to this value by go.
  * Requests with larger headers will result in a 431 status code.

## <a id='install'></a> How to Install

<% if vars.platform_code != 'OFFLINE' %>
To install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, see [Installing
<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>](../operating/installing-pcf-is.html).
<% end %>

To install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must first install Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %>. For more information,
see the [Ops Manager documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/index.html).


## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

There are no new features for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.


## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes

### <a id='jammy-instance-groups'></a> Jammy Stemcell Used For All Instance Groups

All VMs that <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> deploys run on the Jammy Jellyfish stemcell described in [Jammy Jellyfish Stemcell
Support](#ubuntu-jammy) above. Because of this, any add-ons from other tiles or configured in the BOSH Director that are colocated on
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> VMs do not function unless they support the Jammy Jellyfish stemcell.

Tiles that are compatible <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> already work with Jammy Jellyfish stemcells.

Further, the use of the Jammy Stemcell means TAS now requires an Ops Manager with Jammy support, which means Ops Manager version 2.10.33 or greater.

<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following breaking changes:

### <a id='haproxy-removed'></a> HAProxy is Removed

In <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, HAProxy is removed.

If you are upgrading to <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> from <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> v2.13 or earlier, you must
re-configure the following settings in the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile before you upgrade:

* In the **Networking** pane:
  * If you previously selected **HAProxy** under **TLS termination point**, you must select **Gorouter** instead.
  * If you previously configured the **HAProxy IPs** field, you may need to configure the **Gorouter IPs** field instead. Depending on how you configured the
  **Allow SSH access to app containers** and **TCP routing** settings, you may also need to configure the **SSH Proxy IPs** or **TCP router IPs** fields.

* In the **Resource Config** pane:
  * If you previously configured load balancers under the **HAProxy**, you must configure load balancers under the **Router** job instead. Depending on how
  you configured the **Allow SSH access to app containers** and **TCP routing** settings in the **Networking** pane, you may also need to configure load
  balancers under the **Diego Brain** or **TCP Router** jobs.

<% if vars.platform_code != 'OFFLINE' %>
For more information about configuring these settings, see [Configure Networking](../operating/installing-pcf-is.html#networking) and [Configure
Resources](../operating/installing-pcf-is.html#resources) in _Installing <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>_.
<% end %>

### <a id='global-log-rate-limit'></a> Global Log Rate Limit is Deprecated

The global log rate limit that measures app log rates in lines per second is deprecated in favor of per-app log rate limits that measure app log rates in
bytes per second.

If you have configured a global log rate limit in lines per second, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you re-configure your apps to use log rate
limits in bytes per second.

If you still want to use the global log rate limit, logs that exceed the log rate limit are immediately dropped. Previously, logs that exceeded the log rate
limit were buffered and released at the configured log rate.

For more information about app log rate limits, see [App Log Rate Limiting](../loggregator/app-log-rate-limits.html).


## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues

There are no known issues for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.
