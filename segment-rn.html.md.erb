title: Isolation Segment v4.0 Release Notes
owner: Release Engineering
---

Here you will find the release notes for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for 2023.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

  ## Changes
  - A new `localhost:8082` endpoint has been added for retrieving the routing table on gorouter. This is in preparation of removing non-LB-health check endpoints from the public `:8080` listener for increased security.  `/var/vcap/jobs/gorouter/bin/retrieve-local-routes` is updated and still the official way to retrieve the local routing table on a gorouter. The port this listens on can be configured via the `router.status.routes.port` property.
  - A new TLS-enabled endpoint for LB health checks has been added on `:8443`. This can be configured via the `router.status.tls.port`, `router.status.tls.certificate` and `router.status.tls.key` properties.
  - routing-api has been updated to work towards supporting a TLS-only CF deployment. Thanks @reneighbor!
  - gorouter's `proxy` package received some test enhancements for increased test stability. Thanks @domdom82!
  - gorouter's `pool.Endpoint.Equals()` received a performance improvement thanks to @peanball!
  - Route-registrar will now fail if it configured to talk to NATS without using TLS. This can be toggled via the `nats.fail_if_using_nats_without_tls` property. thanks @ameowlia!

  ## Changes
  - Increase default value for `max_policies_per_app_source` from 50 to 150. Thanks SO MUCH @ameowlia !
  - 🐛 Bug fix: update the policy-server `last_updated` timestamp to have microsecond precision. Previously it had second level precision, this created a race condition when multiple c2c policies were updated at nearly the same time, but the vxlan-policy-agent would only pick up the first update. Thank you @geofffranks [for this PR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-release/pull/247)!

  - Bumped to golang 1.21.3
  - Testing updates
  - CI Enhancements
  - Package dependency bumps
  - The `proxy` test/example app's `/dumprequest` endpoint will now return headers back to client via the `returnHeaders` query parameter. It also adds an `X-Proxy-Settable-Debug-Header` header if the upstream server doesn't set it explicitly, and `X-Proxy-Immutable-Debug-Header` which will override any value set by upstream servers.

  ## Changes
  - Healthchecks for process startup have been renamed from "readiness" to "startup" to better indicate that it is the initial liveness check to ensure the process has started. After completing, it is superceded by the liveness check, which has had no changes.
  - Adds support for "readiness" checks on processes. The purpose of readiness checks are to determine whether a process is capable of serving traffic or not. This is contrasted now with liveness checks which determine if the process is in a state that requires it to be restarted. Readiness checks can be used to pull a process out of service when they fail, while not restarting the process. Once readiness is passing again, the process will be re-added into the service pool. Removal/addition of processes to the service pool is done via route-emitter.
  - `cfdot actual-lrps` now behaves in a more expected behavior regarding the display of `host_tls_proxy_port`. It should always be preset, even if the value is `0`.
  - Bumped to golang 1.20.7.

  ## Changes
  - 🐛Fixed a bug with garden-windows where process directories were being leaked in the garden depot. This adds a `garden.cleanup_process_dirs_on_wait` property to mimic cleanup logic from garden-linux. This property is defaulted to true on garden-windows, to keep the desired behavior for CF/Diego. If garden-windows is ever used with Concourse, users will want to set this to false.

  ### Forwarder Agent log format change
  Previously when the `logging.format.timestamp` property was set to `rfc3339` it would be ignored for ingress client logs emitted by the Forwarder Agent. This release applies the correct timestamp format when `rfc3339` is selected, which may affect you if you depend on the format of the logs.
  Old log line format:
  ```
  [INGRESS CLIENT] -> 127.0.0.1:3459: 2023/08/04 21:59:31 Error while flushing: EOF
  ```
  New log line format:
  ```
  2023-08-04T22:23:53.099290367Z [INGRESS CLIENT] -> 127.0.0.1:3459: Error while flushing: EOF

  ## Changes
  - Bumps golang to 1.20.6
  - Resolves a bug in gorouter where path-based routes could return 503s when no backend endpoints remain, rather than falling back to non-path (hostname-only) routes. Thanks @domdom82!

  ## Changes
  - ✨ `route_registrar` now emites route registration events immediately upon startup, rather than waiting for a full registration interval to pass. This will cut down on accidental TTL expiry incurred by restarting route-registrar.
  - ✨ The `router.enable_log_attempts_details` property has been added to allow operators to configure Gorouter to log additional information about retried attempts to send requests to backends. Thanks @maxmoehl!
  - 🐛Specifying multiple CA certs to route_registrar via `route_registrar.routing_api.ca_certs` will now render correctly as multiple certs in a single CA file.
  - 🐛 Routing API clients now correctly refresh their UAA tokens prior to expiry. This should help prevent `route_registrar` from crashing whenever the token expires.
  - Golang package dependency bumps

### <a id='4.0.1'></a> 4.0.1

**Release Date:** 05/17/2023

<%= partial "/pcf/tas/known-issues/multiple-expect-100-continue-tas-4-0" %>

* **[Security Fix]** Whereas TAS 4.0.0 was unaffected by [CVE-2023-20882](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2023-20882-gorouter-pruning-via-client-disconnect-resulting-in-dos/), IST 4.0.1 updates to a routing-release version containing the fix.
* **[Bug Fix]** Fixes an issue in gorouter where requests that should have returned 496, 499, 503, 525, or 526 HTTP status codes may instead have returned as 502s, potentially preventing stale route pruning.
* **[Bug Fix]** Resolve Issue where Garden failed during BOSH/Operations Manager deploys due to healthcheck
* Bump bpm to version `1.2.0`
* Bump cf-networking to version `3.25.1`
* Bump cflinuxfs3 to version `0.364.0`
* Bump cflinuxfs4 to version `1.8.0`
* Bump count-cores-indicator to version `2.0.0`
* Bump diego to version `2.76.0`
* Bump garden-runc to version `1.29.0`

  ## Changes
  ⚠️We have removed the garden-healthcheck job from garden while we investigate a way to make it less painful. From v1.22.6 through v1.28.0, garden restarts with a high container count could result in BOSH deploys failing due to a race condition between garden, bpm, monit, and garden-healthchecker. This will be re-enabled at a later time when we resolve the race condition.

  - 🐛Fixes the of golang has a known issue that causes backend request failures which previously returned 496, 499, 503, 525, or 526 to instead return a 502. Additionally stale routes may not have been pruned properly. Thanks @domdom82!!
  - 🚗Gorouter now retries requests which fail prior to any HTTP content being sent (since no backend received the HTTP content, they're by definition retriable). Thanks for the [PR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/pull/337). Thanks @maxmoehl and @domdom82!!

## <a id='install'></a> How to install

<% if vars.platform_code != 'OFFLINE' %>
To install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, see [Installing
<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>](../operating/installing-pcf-is.html).
<% end %>

To install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must first install Tanzu Operations Manager 3.0. For more information, on how to install Tanzu Operations Manager,
see the [VMware Tanzu Operations Manager documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/index.html).

## <a id='new-features'></a> New features in <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

### Max request header size now defaults to 48 KB
When you Upgrade to IST v4.0 it automatically sets **Max request header size in KB** to 48 KB,
unless the pre-existing configuration was already lower. Lowering this value establishes better security for TAS for VMs and applications. If necessary, this value can still be configured
back up to 1024 KB in the **Networking** tab. Any requests with headers larger than
this value receive a 431 status code.

### Add validation for Certificate Authorities trusted by the Gorouter property
IST 4.0 contains validations for the Certificate Authorities (CA) trusted by the
Gorouter property in the **Networking** tab. Any entries that are not valid CA
certificates can result in an error in Tanzu Operations Manager. You must remove or replace
invalid entries.

### Option to activate (deprecated) Global Log Rate Limit is removed

This feature was in beta until IST v3.0, when it was deprecated following the introduction of app log rate limits.

For details, see [Isolation Segment v3.0 Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/3.0/tas-for-vms/segment-rn.html#global-log-rate-limit-is-deprecated-15) and also [App Log Rate Feature](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/3.0/tas-for-vms/runtime-rn.html#app-log-rate-limits-for-orgs-spaces-and-individual-apps-14).
The option to enable this feature has now been removed, and you must apply app log rate limits instead.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you were using this feature to limit your overall app log
throughput, then you might see an increase in log load after you upgrade. </p>
To
mitigate this, either:

* Scale up your logging system before you upgrade to IST v4.0 to compensate for the increased log load.

  Or

* Upgrade to TAS/IST v3.0 first to set app-level log rate limits while retaining the global log rate limit. For details, see [App Log Rate Limits](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/app-log-rate-limits.html).

## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known issues

<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following known issues:

### Stale routes might not be pruned properly in Gorouter

In addition, request failures that previously resulted in 496, 499, 503, 525, or 526 HTTP Status codes might now return Status Code 502 instead
