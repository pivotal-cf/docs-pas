owner: Release Engineering
---

This topic contains release notes for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for 2023.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

  ## Changes
  ⚠️We have removed the garden-healthcheck job from garden while we investigate a way to make it less painful. From v1.22.6 through v1.28.0, garden restarts with a high container count could result in BOSH deploys failing due to a race condition between garden, bpm, monit, and garden-healthchecker. This will be re-enabled at a later time when we resolve the race condition.

  ## Changes
  - 🐛Fixes the of golang has a known issue that causes backend request failures which previously returned 496, 499, 503, 525, or 526 to instead return a 502. Additionally stale routes may not have been pruned properly. Thanks @domdom82!!
  - 🚗Gorouter now retries requests which fail prior to any HTTP content being sent (since no backend received the HTTP content, they're by definition retriable). Thanks for the [PR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/pull/337). Thanks @maxmoehl and @domdom82!!

  ## Changes
  - Dependency updates (cf cli, healthchecker, golang)
  - Many CI Updates - Thanks @jrussett!
  - 🐛[#310]The routing_utils route loader now sets the route service url when loading. Thanks @domdom82 !
  - 🐛Two issues in route_registrar were fixed that led to routes expiring and then being re-registered with the same details:
  - Starting in v0.x.x, route_registrar no longer retried UAA connections when getting a token from UAA. Instead, the failure would cause route_registrar to restart, and reset it's emitter intervals.
  - The built in route expiry has been increased from RegistrationInterval + 2 seconds to 2.1 * RegistrationInterval. This prevent routes from expiring during the course of a route_registrar restart.
  - 🐛If tcp_router received routing events during its BulkSync cycle, it would always rewrite the haproxy configuration, and reload the haproxy process. This would occur regardless of whether the events required a new haproxy config. It now only updates the config + reloads haproxy if changes are necessary.

  ## What's Changed
  - When the `router.ca_certs` property switched from a multi-line string of certs, to an array of certs, gorouter started failing to start up if any of the certs provided were invalid. Previously they were ignored. This has been reverted, so that any invalid CA certs are ignored during startup. Thanks @ameowlia!

  ## What's Changed
  * Switch to healthecker package in cf-networking-helpers by @mariash in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/pull/302
  * Add healthchecker package to sync-package-specs file by @mariash in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/pull/303
  * **Potential Breaking Change:** In preperation for mtls between gorouter and routing api, add gorouter backends ca to routing-api. Rendering these certs depends on routing-api consuming a link from gorouter. If you have multiple gorouter instance groups (for example in the case of isolation segments), you will need to rename bosh links to prevent the error "Multiple link providers found. For an example of link renaming, see [this ops file](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/main/operations/test/add-persistent-isolation-segment-router.yml#L74) by @reneighbor in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/pull/300

  ## What's Changed
  * Gorouter's pre-start script now reserves ports used by other CF components when it increases the number of ephemeral ports available via `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_reserved_ports`. This resolves issues when components fail to start up during deploys/monit restarts due to accidental port collisions with outbound traffic from the VM. Thanks @ameowlia !
  * Routing-release no longer makes use of the deprecated uaa-go-client, and uses go-uaa instead
  * The `routing_utils/nats_client` helper utility now supports saving + loading gorouter's routing tables! Thanks @domdom82 !
  * Fixed a memory leak with `gorouter` that resulted in HTTP request objects being held open if a client canceled the connection before the App responded.  Thanks @geofffranks !

  -  `tcp_router` is now more verbose when running `haproxy_reloader` to assist in diagnosting failed reloads. Thanks @geofffranks! 🎉 ([PR 9](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-tcp-router/pull/9))
  - `gorouter` will now truncate access logs that exceed loggregator + UDP packet limits, so that we no longer drop access log messages sent to the firehose. Thanks @ameowlia @ebroberson! 😻 ([PR 328](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/pull/328) and [PR 329](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/pull/329))

  ## What's Changed
  * @geofffranks and @ameowlia added property `router.max_header_bytes` to the gorouter job.
  * This value controls the maximum number of bytes the gorouter will read parsing the request header's keys and values, including the request line.
  * It does not limit the size of the request body.
  * An additional padding of 4096 bytes is added to this value by go.
  * Requests with larger headers will result in a 431 status code.

  ## Changes
  * Adds support for a new byte-based log rate limiting mechanism with per-LRP limits.
  * Behavior of existing line-based log rate limiting has also changed to drop log messages immediately rather than releasing them from a buffer with a delay. Therefore timestamps of the logs will now match when they were output.

  ## Changes
  - Replace GinkgoParallelNode with GinkgoParallelProcess @ebroberson (#630)
  - Bump Golang to go1.18.4 @cf-diego (#625)
  **Breaking Changes**: The diego components are now more strict about the protocols used in TLS communications, causing integrations with systems using older, insecure protocols to fail. These components have been updated to Go 1.18, and will no longer support TLS 1.0 and 1.1 connections or certificates with a SHA-1 checksum. This is most likely to affect connections with external databases.

### <a id='2-13-3'></a> v2.13.3

**Release Date:** 06/24/2022

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning: Upcoming reduction in maintenance and security release coverage!</strong> In future patches, no sooner than July 1st 2022, some TAS components will become more strict about the protocols used in TLS communications, causing integrations with systems using older, insecure protocols to fail. Specifically, components built using the Go programming language will no longer support TLS 1.0 or 1.1, or certificates using SHA-1. In order to avoid breaking changes in this version line, (which has reached its End of General Support,) these components will no longer be updated with bug and security fixes in any patches that may be released. To continue receiving maintenance and security releases, upgrade to a version of TAS that remains in general support.</p>

* Bump diego to version `2.62.0`

### <a id='2-13-2'></a> v2.13.2

**Release Date:** 06/09/2022

<p class='note warning'><strong> Warning:</strong> Breaking change. This version contains Diego 2.64.0, which bumps to Go 1.18. Go 1.18 no longer supports TLS 1.0 and 1.1 connections or certificates with a SHA-1 checksum. This is most likely to affect connections with external databases. We stated earlier that we wouldn't bump to Go 1.18 until July 1, 2022. This TAS release with Diego 2.64.0 breaks that promise. We apologize. We are rolling back to Diego 2.62.0.  If you already successfully deployed to this TAS release with Diego 2.64.0, then you are safe to continue using it.</p>

* **[Bug Fix]** Sticky sessions no longer break when used with route-services that return HTTP 4xx/5xx responses
* **[Breaking Change]** Syslog drains configured to use TLS now [reject certificates signed with the SHA-1 hash function](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18#sha1).

## <a id='install'></a> How to Install

To install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, see [Installing
<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>](../operating/installing-pcf-is.html).

To install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must first install <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10. For more information, see the
[<%= vars.ops_manager %> documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/index.html).


## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id='dynamic-asg'></a> Dynamic App Security Group Rules

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> introduces dynamic App Security Groups (ASGs).

ASGs are a collection of egress rules that specify the protocols, ports, and IP address ranges where app or task instances send traffic. Previously, updating
an existing ASG required you to restart the app before the ASG went into effect.

Dynamic ASGs can automatically update security groups without requiring an app restart. If you have existing ASGs, you can run any of the security group cf
CLI commands, including `cf bind-security-group` and `update-security-group`, and the changes apply automatically to any running apps.

For more information about ASGs, see [App Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html).


## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes

<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following breaking changes:

### <a id='certs-require-san'></a> Gorouter Certificates Require a SAN Extension

In <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, all Gorouter certificates require a valid subjectAltName (SAN) extension. If any Gorouter
certificates lack a SAN, Go clients cannot connect to servers and deployment fails.

Before you upgrade to <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must do the following:

1. Verify that all certificates in <%= vars.ops_manager %> use a valid SAN. If they do not, rotate your certificates using a valid SAN.

1. Verify that all external systems that the Gorouter connects to have certificates with a valid SAN. If you use route services, this includes either the
route services themselves or the load balancer in front of the route service.

If you need to complete a deployment before configuring new Gorouter certificates, activate the **Enable temporary workaround for certs without SANs**
checkbox in the **Networking** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

For more information about updating certificates, see [Routing and Golang 1.15 X.509 CommonName
deprecation](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Routing-and-golang-1-15-X-509-CommonName-deprecation) in the Knowledge Base.

### <a id='ip-leading-zero'></a> Golang v1.17 Rejects IP Addresses with Leading Zeros

Golang v1.17 contains stricter IP parsing standards, so IP addresses with leading zeros in any octets cause a BOSH template failure. Operators can remove the
leading zeros and try deploying again. This affects properties that feed into all releases that use Golang v1.17. For a complete list, see
[<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Components Use Golang v1.17](runtime-rn.html#golang-1-17) in _<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> Release
Notes_.

Syslog drains and metric registrar endpoints that are registered using user-provided services might also be affected.


## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues

<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> currently has no known issues.
