title: Isolation Segment v5.0 Release notes
owner: Release Engineering
---

Here you will find the release notes for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> is certified by the Cloud Foundry Foundation for 2023.

For more information about the Cloud Foundry Certified Provider Program, see [How Do I Become a Certified
Provider?](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms-how-to/) on the Cloud Foundry website.

Because VMware uses the Percona Distribution for MySQL, expect a time lag between Oracle releasing a MySQL patch and VMware releasing
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> containing that patch.

  ## Changes
  - A new `localhost:8082` endpoint has been added for retrieving the routing table on gorouter. This is in preparation of removing non-LB-health check endpoints from the public `:8080` listener for increased security.  `/var/vcap/jobs/gorouter/bin/retrieve-local-routes` is updated and still the official way to retrieve the local routing table on a gorouter. The port this listens on can be configured via the `router.status.routes.port` property.
  - A new TLS-enabled endpoint for LB health checks has been added on `:8443`. This can be configured via the `router.status.tls.port`, `router.status.tls.certificate` and `router.status.tls.key` properties.
  - routing-api has been updated to work towards supporting a TLS-only CF deployment. Thanks @reneighbor!
  - gorouter's `proxy` package received some test enhancements for increased test stability. Thanks @domdom82!
  - gorouter's `pool.Endpoint.Equals()` received a performance improvement thanks to @peanball!
  - Route-registrar will now fail if it configured to talk to NATS without using TLS. This can be toggled via the `nats.fail_if_using_nats_without_tls` property. thanks @ameowlia!

  ## Changes
  - Increase default value for `max_policies_per_app_source` from 50 to 150. Thanks SO MUCH @ameowlia !
  - 🐛 Bug fix: update the policy-server `last_updated` timestamp to have microsecond precision. Previously it had second level precision, this created a race condition when multiple c2c policies were updated at nearly the same time, but the vxlan-policy-agent would only pick up the first update. Thank you @geofffranks [for this PR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-release/pull/247)!

  - CI Enhancements
  - Package dependency bumps
  - The `proxy` test/example app's `/dumprequest` endpoint will now return headers back to client via the `returnHeaders` query parameter. It also adds an `X-Proxy-Settable-Debug-Header` header if the upstream server doesn't set it explicitly, and `X-Proxy-Immutable-Debug-Header` which will override any value set by upstream servers.
